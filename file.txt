GIT

Git allows us tracking the changes of any plain text. To do this, follow the next steps:

1.- Inside the selected directory, we activate the system version control of Git by executing:
 git init

2.- We change the untracked file status to staged by executing: 
git add file.extension
Or to ad all the files to the repository:
 git add . 

3.- We move file changes or updates from untracked to staged by executing: 
 git commit -m "comment something about the changes here"

After doing add and commit (step 2 and 3) at least one time, we can use:
 git commit -am "comment something about the changes here"

USING BRANCHES

At the begining we are in the 'master' branch,

1.- To create a branch we use:
 git branch branch_name

WE can see the available branches by executing:
 git branch

2.- We change branch by executing:
 git checkout branch_name

4.- For MERGE branches by executing:
 git merge -m "comment something here"
